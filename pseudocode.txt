// My algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles (maybe not the most efficient):
// Recursive

look at empty cell
if DNE, return true
using nums 1-9 as possible values to fill, start low to high
check for conflict with num x at location p
if no conflict
	assign x to p
	recurse on location p+1
	if success, return true
	else, try the next number x+1 (or x+2 or whatever)
	if no digit works, return false (unsolvable)
